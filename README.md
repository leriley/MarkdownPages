### What We're Here To Do
These markdown pages will serve as a tutorial for making custom heads for *The Sims* (2000). I am creating this tutorial mostly for myself because I go months and months without playing and inevitably forget
how to create custom heads, then need to do internet archeology in the wayback machine to remember how. This is also a good opportunity to create a tutorial which I was wanting to make anyway, but was putting off because I didn't want to deal with the markdown on the website I upload my content to. It is very difficult to find information about the original *Sims* game since many, many "early internet" websites have been lost to time, so creating more easily-accessible information about *The Sims* is a small way to help preserve this historic, genre-defining, yet forgotten gaming gem.
