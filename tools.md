# Tools for Creating Sims 1 Custom Content
First off, to create custom content for a video game, you probably want to have that video game. *The Sims* (2000) and *The Sims 2* (2004) are considered abandonware, 
and thus are no longer available for purchase. 
- User Osab has created Starter Packs for *The Sims* and *The Sims 2*, which are available on [their GitHub](https://github.com/voicemxil)
- [You will need Skn2Obj](https://www.kelahn.com/SKN2OBJ.htm) for creating the .SKN mesh files that *The Sims* uses
  -   If the program does not run, there are instructions at the bottom of the download page to remedy this
- [Milkshape 3D](http://www.milkshape3d.com/ms3d/download.html)
  - This is a **paid program** and bad people have put registration information avilable publicly online. It would be morally wrong and unethical to use this information to register your copy. I do not recommend you do this.
- (Optional) [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
   - .OBJ files straight out of Blender do not seem to show up in the game for whatever reason (appearing "invisible" in-game), and I always export from Milkshape instead.
- An image editing program capable of creating **Indexed BMP Files** (very important)
- [The Sims Creator](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sims_Creator) or SimEnhancer
  - Archived versions of TSC and SimEnhancer can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/TheSimsCreator) (archive.org) and [here](https://modthesims.info/showthread.php?p=5828020#post5828020) (modthesims)
