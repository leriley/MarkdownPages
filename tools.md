# Tools for Creating Sims 1 Custom Content
First off, to create custom content for a video game, you probably want to have that video game. *The Sims* (2000) and *The Sims 2* (2004) are considered abandonware, 
and thus are no longer available for purchase. 
- User Osab has created Starter Packs for *The Sims* and *The Sims 2*, which are available on [their GitHub](https://github.com/voicemxil)
