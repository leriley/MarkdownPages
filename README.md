### What We're Here To Do
These markdown pages will serve as a tutorial for making custom heads for *The Sims* (2000). This is a good opportunity to create a tutorial which I was wanting to make anyway for the larger *Sims* community in general, but was putting off because I didn't want to deal with the markdown on the website I upload my content to.  

It is very difficult to find information about the original *Sims* game since many, many "early internet" websites have been lost to time, so creating more easily-accessible information about *The Sims* is a small way to help preserve this historic, genre-defining, yet largely forgotten gaming gem. There's something I really love about this simple little dollhouse game, so I'm eager to share what I know about it.
