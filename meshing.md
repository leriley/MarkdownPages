# Readying the Mesh
To create a new head, you'll need a mesh! I always convert my meshes from other video games (usually *The Sims 2*). 
Today I'll be taking a head mesh from a mod for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* and converting it to *The Sims 1*. I already have my meshes and textures ready to go, so I'll import the meshes into my 3D program. You can use Blender, I'll use Milkshape.

There's already a couple big problems: The head is facing downward, and it's huge. So I've also imported another mesh for size reference. See that red spot in the middle? That's about the size and orientation we need our mesh to be. This is where blender can come in, if you want: It's a lot easier and quicker to resize the head mesh in Blender.
